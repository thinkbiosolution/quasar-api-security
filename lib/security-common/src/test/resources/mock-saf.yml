# This file is used by the SafResourceAccessDummy class for testing and when the service is running outside of z/OS
# It defines what are the access levels for SAF resources and users
#
# There are to special values of access level:
#  - `FAILURE` - the check request will fail with an internal error
#  - `NONE` - there is no access to the resource but the resource is defined
#
# This file is stored in `src/main/resources/mock-saf.yml` which means that it will be used by the service and its unit tests.
# If you can create a different file in `src/test/resources/mock-saf.yml` then unit tests will use different definitions.
